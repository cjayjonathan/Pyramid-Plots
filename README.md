# Pyramid-Plots
Pyramid plots are a type of chart that displays data in a way that resembles a pyramid. The chart is divided into horizontal bars, which are arranged from largest to smallest, with the tallest bars at the bottom and the shortest bars at the top. The bars can be labeled to represent different categories or segments of data.
